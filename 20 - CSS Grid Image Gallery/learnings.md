# Learnings
## New things learned
* Running document.querySelector on another object (can be something other than document)
* Making an array of n size by psaasying an object with size n to Array.from such as
const nums = Array.from({length: 50}, value)
* Object fit CSS Property: According to MDN: The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container.
* Overlapping two items on the grid (z-index comes to play)
* RRGGBBAA color notation (adding transparency to hex colour value)
 

## Refreshers
* box-sizing: border-box
* linear-gradient function (and passing it to background)
